### What I do
I find bugs in smart contracts: bounties, audits, etc.

### 🏆 Credentials  
- #22 for 2023 on [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/leaderboard/) having found several live criticals.
- Very experienced auditor, developer, and researcher.

### 🥇 Value prop for audits
- Will provide an exceptional quality audit.
- Will work hard and find bugs others would miss.
- Will point out economic exploits and weaknesses.
- Will suggest code, architecture, and maintainability improvements.
- Will then find bugs in your fixes.

### 👀 Look Before You Book
Feel free to ask for an example of a past audit.
